                We don’t tolerate discrimination against protected characteristics (gender, age, sexual orientation, race, nationality, ethnicity, religion, disability, veteran status.) 
                We want all employees (including executives and HR) to treat others with respect and professionalism. <br/><br/>
                In practice, this means that we:
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Hire and promote people based on skills, experience or potential and try to reduce bias in every process (e.g. through structured interviews.)</em></li>

                    <li><em>Conduct diversity and communication training.</em></li>
                </ul>
                Apart from those actions, we commit to penalizing every discriminatory, offensive or inappropriate behavior. To do this properly, we ask you to report any discriminatory action against yourself or your colleagues to HR. 
                Our company will not retaliate against you if you file a complaint or discrimination lawsuit. Any employee who retaliates or discriminates will face disciplinary action.
